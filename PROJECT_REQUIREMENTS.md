## Business Logic Rules

### Pricing Rules
1. **Original Price**:
   - Cost price entered by mechanic
2. **Selling Price**: 
   - Original price + markup (mechanic's choice):
     - **Percentage markup**: 
       - Original price Ã— (1 + markup percentage)
     - **Fixed value markup**: 
       - Original price + fixed markup amount
3. **Per-Part Flexibility**: 
   - Each part can have different markup methods
4. **Invoice Total**: 
   - Sum of all marked-up items
5. **Minimum Markup**: 
   - System should enforce minimum profitable markup (configurable)

### Stock Management
1. Stock count reduces when items added to invoice
2. Prevent overselling
   - Quantity > stock
3. Alert when stock is low
   - Configurable threshold
4. Stock updates in real-time across sections

### Invoice Management
1. Sequential invoice numbering
2. Invoice cannot be deleted
   - Business audit trail
3. Date/time stamp on all invoices
4. PDF must match screen display exactly
